Paper straws are a brown!

"If the straw has a glossy shine on the inside or outside, it must be labelled as 'compostable'.

This ensures that the straw does not contain any plastic and is ok to
&#x20;compost. If the paper straw is not labelled as compostable, put in the&#x20;
black cart as garbage." \[1]
