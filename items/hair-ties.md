recommendedProductReason: >
  These hair ties are made with organic cotton and natural tree rubber.&#x20;


  While they may not be suitable for composting in municipal or commercial
  facilities, the cotton (which makes up 70% of the hair tie) is compostable and
  the rubber will biodegrade in a much shorter time frame (2-10 years) than
  synthetic rubbers, which can take
  [centuries](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8235351/ "Time to
  Decompose Rubber") to decompose.&#x20;


  Choose these eco-friendly hair ties as a more sustainable alternative.
